# Hello!

I am RalphOfficial. I like to make Minecraft Resource Packs and Mods.

## Resources
These resources might be useful your you idk
***
IntelliJ Idea IDE (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) : Pretty good IDE for intermediate programmers. Not really much to say.
***
Vistual Studio Code IDE (https://code.visualstudio.com) : Extrememly good IDE if you're just starting out as a programmer.
***
Paint.net (https://getpaint.net) : Pretty good and handy alternative to photoshop.
***
Blockbench (https://www.blockbench.net) : Very good Modelling software for Minecraft. I believe even some of the Mojang devs use this (im not sure).
***
Sublime text (https://www.sublimetext.com) : Very good text editor for quick .json editing
***
I might add more to this list as time goes on and I learn about more interesting stuff.
